## Introduction to Accounting

Accounting is the process of recording, classifying, and summarizing financial transactions to provide useful financial information for decision-making. A core part of accounting is **journalizing**, which involves recording transactions in the appropriate accounts. Each transaction impacts at least two accounts, typically involving a **debit** and a **credit**.

### **Key Accounting Concepts:**
1. **Debits and Credits**: 
   - A **debit** entry increases assets and expenses, and decreases liabilities and equity.
   - A **credit** entry increases liabilities and equity, and decreases assets and expenses.
   
2. **Journal Entries**: 
   - A journal entry records a transaction. For example, if a company buys an asset for cash, it would debit the asset account and credit the cash account.
   
3. **Prepaid Expenses**:
   - **Prepaid expenses** are payments made in advance for goods or services to be received in the future. Initially, they are recorded as **assets** and then moved to **expenses** over time as the benefit is used up.
   
4. **Accrued Expenses**:
   - **Accrued expenses** are expenses that have been incurred but not yet paid. These are liabilities that are recorded in the period the expense is recognized.

## How to Use This System

1. **Journal Entry Form**:
   - You will input transactions using a **journal entry form** where you select account types (e.g., **Asset**, **Liability**, **Revenue**, **Expense**) and input amounts for **debit** and **credit**.
   - Optionally, you can check the **Accrued** and **Prepaid** checkboxes to automate the handling of accrued and prepaid expenses.
   
2. **Accrued and Prepaid Entries**:
   - **Accrued**: If checked, the system automatically generates an **accrued liability** entry and recognizes an expense for the current period.
   - **Prepaid**: If checked, the system creates a **prepaid asset** and moves the prepaid amount into an expense over time.
   
3. **Display and Track Journal Entries**:
   - After submitting your journal entry, it will be stored and displayed on the interface.
   - The system also maintains a running balance, updating the **Asset**, **Liability**, **Equity**, **Revenue**, and **Expense** totals dynamically.
   
4. **Generate Financial Reports**:
   - Once journal entries are made, you can generate key financial documents:
     - **Balance Sheet**: A snapshot of assets, liabilities, and equity.
     - **Income Statement**: A report of revenues and expenses over a period.
     - **Cash Flow Statement**: A report of cash inflows and outflows.
     - **Owner's Equity**: A statement detailing capital contributions and drawings.

## Detailed Explanation of Prepaid and Accrued Entries

### **Prepaid Expenses (Asset)**:
When a payment is made for a good or service that will be received in the future, it’s recorded as a **prepaid expense** (an asset), and it is gradually amortized into an **expense** account over the duration of the benefit period.

#### Example:
- **Scenario**: A company pays $1,200 for 12 months of insurance coverage.
- **Journal Entry** (When paid):
  - **Debit**: **Prepaid Insurance (Asset)** $1,200
  - **Credit**: **Cash** $1,200
- **Monthly Amortization (after 1 month)**:
  - **Debit**: **Insurance Expense** $100
  - **Credit**: **Prepaid Insurance (Asset)** $100

### **Accrued Expenses (Liability)**:
Accrued expenses are expenses that are **recognized** but not yet paid. These represent future cash obligations.

#### Example:
- **Scenario**: Wages are owed to employees at the end of the month but not paid until the next period.
- **Journal Entry** (At the end of the month):
  - **Debit**: **Wages Expense** $500
  - **Credit**: **Accrued Wages (Liability)** $500

The system handles this by automatically adjusting the ledger with the appropriate entries when the **Accrued** checkbox is checked.
